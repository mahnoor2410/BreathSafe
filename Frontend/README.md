## Project Overview

Air quality issues pose significant health risks, often undetected until severe. **BreathSafe** leverages AI to address this challenge with a Gemini-powered chatbot for personalized health guidance and real-time AQI monitoring. Its user-friendly React JS interface, secure Flask backend, and scalable database design make it ideal for monitoring air quality and managing health data.

---

## Features

- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Query air quality or health issues using Gemini, with responses saved for 7 days.
- **Real-Time AQI Monitoring**: View AQI and pollutants (CO, NO2, PM2.5, PM10) with hourly, daily, and weekly forecasts.
- **Health Recommendations**: AI-generated short-term and long-term suggestions based on AQI levels.
- **User Profile Management**: Secure signup, login, and password updates via React JS.
- **Chat History**: View, edit titles, or delete chatbot interactions.
- **Secure & Scalable**: Flask-Login and Flask-Migrate ensure robust authentication and database management.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage users and system settings.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask, Flask-Login, Flask-Migrate, Flask-CORS, SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend**: React JS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, `react-router-dom`, `react-icons`, `styled-components`, Axios
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)
- **AI/ML**: Gemini model (via `gemini_config`)
- **Dev Tools**: `requests`, `markupsafe`, `logging`, `re`, `datetime`

---

## System Architecture

- **Authentication System**: Flask-Login manages secure user signup, login, and session handling.
- **Real Time AQI Monitoring**:User selects location via interactive map; system retrieves real-time AQI data (CO, NO‚ÇÇ, PM2.5, PM10), displays trends, short-term alerts, and long-term health suggestions.
- **Chatbot Support**: Gemini model processes user queries for personalized air quality and health guidance.
- **Web Platform**: React JS frontend handles user interactions, AQI visualization, chatbot conversation, and profile management.
- **Data Storage**: SQLite/PostgreSQL stores user data, chat history, and AQI records.
- **API Layer**: Flask RESTful APIs (/api/signup, /api/chatbot, etc.) enable frontend-backend communication.
